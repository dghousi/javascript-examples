    <h1>
        What is this?
    </h1>
    <pre>
        In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.

        Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).

        The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:

        In an object method, this refers to the object.
        Alone, this refers to the global object.
        In a function, this refers to the global object.
        In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
        In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
        Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.
    </pre>

    <h1><b>this</b> in a method</h1>

    <pre>
        When used in an object method, this refers to the object.

        In the example on top of this page, this refers to the person object.

        Because the fullName method is a method of the person object.
    </pre>

    <h1>        
        this in a Function (Default)
    </h1>

    <pre>
        In a function, the global object is the default binding for this.

        In a browser window the global object is [object Window]:

        Example
        function myFunction() {
            return this;
        }
    </pre>

    <h1>        this in a Function (Strict)
    </h1>

    <pre>
        JavaScript strict mode does not allow default binding.

        So, when used in a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.

        Example
        "use strict";
        function myFunction() {
            return this;
        }
    </pre>

    <h1>
        this in Event Handlers
    </h1>

    <pre>
        In HTML event handlers, this refers to the HTML element that received the event:

        Example
        <button onclick="this.style.display='none'">
            Click to Remove Me!
        </button>
    </pre>

    <h1>        
        Object Method Binding
    </h1>

    <pre>
        In these examples, this is the person object:

        Example
        const person = {
            firstName  : "John",
            lastName   : "Doe",
            id         : 5566,
            myFunction : function() {
                return this;
            }
        };

        <b>i.e. this.firstName is the firstName property of this (the person object). </b>
    </pre>

    <h1>        
        Explicit Function Binding
    </h1>

    <pre>
        The call() and apply() methods are predefined JavaScript methods.

        They can both be used to call an object method with another object as argument.
    </pre>

    <h1>        
        Function Borrowing
    </h1>
    <pre>
        With the bind() method, an object can borrow a method from another object.

        This example creates 2 objects (person and member).

        The member object borrows the fullname method from the person object:

        Example
        const person = {
            firstName:"John",
            lastName: "Doe",
            fullName: function () {
                return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
            }
        }

        const member = {
            firstName:"Hege",
            lastName: "Nilsen",
        }

        let fullName = person.fullName.bind(member);
    </pre>

    <h1>
        This Precedence
    </h1>
    <pre>
        To determine which object this refers to; Use the following precedence of order.

        Precedence	Object
        1	bind()
        2	apply() and call()
        3	Object method
        4	Global scope
        Is this in a function being called using bind()?

        Is this in a function is being called using apply()?

        Is this in a function is being called using call()?

        Is this in an object function (method)?

        Is this in a function in the global scope.
    </pre>

        setTimeout(user2.logMessage(), 1000); // in this situation the logMessage method is called and this is refering to the parent object and it prints Dawlatzai Ghousi;



        const user3 = {
